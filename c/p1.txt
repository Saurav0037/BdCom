1. Why do we use C in embedded system? Why don't we use other high-level Programming Language,like Java/Python/C++? Why don't use assembly language?
2. What is a compiled language? What is an interpreted language? Which languages are compiled? Which languages are interpreted? What's the difference between them? What are the advantages and disadvantages? What is syntax checking in compilation and What is semantic checking?

4. What are the steps and tools needed to go from a C program to an executable program? What do these tools do? Why are these steps needed?

1.Use different options in gcc to see the input, output and role of different compilation tools
Use readelf to view the composition of an executable file. What sections are made up of an 2.executable file? Draw a picture. What do these sections do?
3.Is it possible to mix C and assembly programming? How to do it? (You can find examples on the Internet to verify.)
